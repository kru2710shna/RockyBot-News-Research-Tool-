## Overview
**RockyBot** is designed for researching and answering queries based on news articles. Users can input the URLs of the news articles, and RockyBot processes the text, stores embeddings in a FAISS index, and retrieves answers to user questions with references to the source articles.

This project leverages various state-of-the-art machine learning and NLP techniques, making it a powerful tool for researchers, journalists, or anyone looking to analyze and extract information from news articles.

## Features
- **Article Processing**: Input URLs of news articles and automatically extract content.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions based on the content of the news articles.
- **Source References**: Get references for the sources used in generating the answers.
- **FAISS Index**: Uses FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
- **OpenAI LLM**: Integrates OpenAI for generating embeddings and processing natural language queries.
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-powered simple, user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain): For creating retrieval chains.
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): For building the web interface.
  - [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/): For generating sentence embeddings.
  - [FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss): For vector storage and similarity search.
